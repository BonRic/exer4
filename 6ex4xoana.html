        <p class="txt">The portfolio of LA-based illustrator Xoana Herrera is an explosion of sumptuous, stylish 
            character scenes dwelling in a world that, frankly, looks ideal. Xoana trained as a graphic designer 
            in Argentina but over time found herself drawn to the world of illustration after a five-year stint at 
            Buck agency. Now, alongside founding a feminist creative collective, Get it Girl, she creates graceful, 
            complex and accessible imagery which would be as at home in an ad campaign as it would be in a children’s 
            book (which she's quite keen to try soon). “As an artist I think it is up to us to keep evolving and taking 
            creative decisions,” she says. “Aiming to be innovative is something I feel I can dare to try every time 
            I take a job, and that’s amazing.”</p>
