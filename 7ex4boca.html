        <p class="txt">La Boca have the rare, impressive ability to create designs and artwork resembling some of the 
            best album sleeves lurking in your dad’s record collection. The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west 
            London and has gathered an envious collection of awards, including Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, 
            and the AOI Illustration Awards. Their exquisitely executed, psychedelic style is the combined result of 
            each of the studio's members' unique influences, having hailed from London, Bordeaux, Devon and Switzerland. 
            “We work as a studio, so most of our designs are created as a team,” says Scott Bendall of La Boca. “It's not 
            unusual to have two or three people working on a single piece.” Keen to work on more animated projects in the 
            future, the team (based in two studios, one in London and one in Amsterdam) are never short on work from a 
            selection of devoted clients. In their own words, La Boca’s creations are: “Retina teasing, tactile and 
            occasionally slightly wonky.”
